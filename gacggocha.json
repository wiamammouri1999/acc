      "text": "Game development company Lunime has made a name for itself, creating popular role-playing games such as Gachaverse and Neko Gacha. This time, they are giving their fans the freedom to create their own content. Gacha Life is a casual game created for Android and iOS devices. Players will be able to create multiple original characters using the game's extensive customization options.  Several aspects of each character can be modified, including hair color, eye shape, height, outfits, etc. Even better, all customization options are available from the moment you enter the game. This means that you do not need to advance in the game before you can create the character of your dreams. After creating avatars, players can then make comics, set up scenes, play mini-games, and develop relationships with other characters. There is so much to do in the game, and our Gacha Life guide, which includes a number of tips, tricks, and cheats, is here to guide you through it all!"

      "text": "        <p>1. Create your own characters</p><p>gacha . life cheat</p><p>You read         that right, you can create multiple characters. There are eight         character slots on the left side of the main screen, and each slot is         filled with a pre-made character. Feel free to free any of these         characters because all these slots are yours to fill. There are also 12         additional slots for additional characters that you can access by         clicking the Slots + button. Characters that occupy the first eight         slots will only be available when you're in Studio or Skit Maker mode,         so don't forget to switch the characters you want to use.</p><p>There         are pages upon pages of character customization options. Press any of         the buttons on the right side of the home screen to get started. Don't         worry because you won't need to go back to the main screen if you decide         to make changes to a different part of your character's body. When         browsing the different options for each body part, you can either click         on the arrow buttons or click on the item itself to open all the         available designs. Once you are done with the visual changes, don't         forget to drop into the profile section to set your character's name as         well as the rest of the personal details.<br />2. Try studio mode</p><p>Studio         mode allows you to create scenes using all the characters in the first 8         slots. This means that you can set up a group photo of all of your         original characters, or you can come up with a scenario where they all         interact. Tap each character's icon at the bottom of the screen to place         them in the scene. You can then change the background, add props, edit         their chat bubbles, put them all on screen, and so on. Feel free to edit         as much as you like until you are satisfied with the scenario you have         created. Once done, you can click the Hide button in the upper right         corner of the screen to remove the interface, allowing you to take a         clear picture of the scene you just created. You can also save up to         nine different scenes and reload them if you want to edit.<br />3. Make your own skits</p><p>life tips gacha</p><p>Another         unique feature of the game is Skit Maker. This allows you to create         your own stories that include different characters. Your stunts can         contain up to 100 scenes but you can only have up to two characters on         screen at a time. To create a scene, first choose the position of the         characters on the screen. Then, you can choose a character for the left         side and one for the right side of the scene. You can add speech bubbles         to each of them in the white squares in the middle. On the right side         are options for changing the background, the character's facial         expressions, and poses. You can also copy the details of an existing         scene by clicking the Copy button on the right.</p><p>If you want to see         what the sitcom looks like, you can click the Test Skit button at the         bottom of the screen. Once you're satisfied, simply click Save Skit and         then click the Start Skit button to watch your creation unfold. Make         sure to change Max Lines from 100 to the number of actual scenes you've         created. Otherwise, it will go through all 100 lines even if they are         empty. Keep in mind that clicking the New Skit button will delete all         the lines you've created, so make sure you don't mind losing your         current skit before creating a new one.<br />4. Rush to level 10</p><p>One         of the few things that are actually locked in Gacha Life is the chat         feature. You won't be able to chat with other players until you reach         level 10. The whole point of playing a casual game where you create your         own characters, avatars, and scenes is to be able to share them with         like-minded people, right? Dash to level 10 so you can join the         community and share everything you've done so far. In order to level up,         you will need to play in Lifestyle. Develop your relationships with         different life style characters in order to level up your player.</p>"
